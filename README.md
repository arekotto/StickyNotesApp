# StickyNotesApp
An experimental app to explore Objective-C and C++ integration.

As a developer who started his journey with iOS when Swift was already around the only experience with Objective-C I had to date, was by reading through it in older StackOverflow posts and learning about its influence on some of the APIs used in Swift. Being curious to learn what iOS development looked like before the introduction of Swift, I decided to start a small project in Objective-C to gain some hands on experience with it. While I was at it, I thought it might be beneficial to refresh some of my C++ skills learned at university.

The final result of that is a small app, that allows users to take small notes in the form of stickies. The UI is written in Objective-C. The data entered by the user, gets passed to a C++ database engine through a Objective-C++ interface. After that the data is persisted in a file.
